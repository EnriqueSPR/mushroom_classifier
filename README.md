# Mushroom classifier (CNN)

The goal in this project is to train a CNN to classify pictures of mushrooms in over 800 different species.

## Summary:

Mushrooms represent an important food source and they are used extensively in cooking, in many cuisines (notably Chinese, Korean, European, and Japanese). Furthermore, many people enjoy mushroom collection as a outdoor activity. However, this activity, entails some health risk, since some species that are poisoness look similar to edible specimens. In the example below I present such case of similarity between a delicious and edible mushroom *Macrolepiota mastoidea* and a *Amanita phaloides* which ingestion can lead to death.

Hence, it is important to discern what mushrooms are safe to pick.

In this notebook, I will train an algorithm that can aid us in classifying mushroom species.
